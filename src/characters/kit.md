# Kit Welsh

Kit Welsh is a no-nonsense raccoon that went to [Golden Oak Academy](../locations/goldenoak.md) to become a medical practitioner and works at [Healthstone Clinic](./../locations/healthstone.md) in Furtropolis. He provides annual medical exams, vaccines, treatments and medication to his patients. Kit adopted the orphaned [Zack Casey](zackc.md) when the fennec was a cub.

Kit keeps up to date with the latest scientific news and will inform his patients of anything that'll benefit his patients, such as letting [Vincent](vincent.md) know that his gloominess is not part of an imbalance.
