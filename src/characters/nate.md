# Nate Holland

Nate Holland is a clever long-eared rabbit that lives at [Maple Valley Acres](../locations/maplevalley.md). While loyal to the friends he knows, Nate shows a certain reluctance to welcome newcomers. Nonetheless, he warms up to all of them in time. Nate likes to take charge and come up with elaborate plans even though they don't always go his way. He routinely sells his produce from Maple Valley to local restaurants in [Furtropolis](../locations/furtropolis.md).
