# Vincent Cooper

Living on the southwest corner of the city, Vincent Cooper is a pessimistic and gloomy old donkey. He is hardly ever happy, and even when he is, he's still sardonic and a bit cynical. Ironically, Vincent actually enjoys his gloomy nature after Kit Welsh discovered studies that showed his mood wasn't the result of an imbalance. He has taking a liking to poems but struggles with making his own.
