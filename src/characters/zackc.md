# Zack Casey

Zack Casey is a socially awkward young adult fennec in his early 20s that has blue fur that loves loves trains and science. He grew up as an orphan until he was adopted by [Kit Welsh](kit.md). Kit helped teach the fennec about science when he handed down his chemistry set. Despite his occasional social screw ups, Zack does mean well and tries his best to be helpful when he can.
