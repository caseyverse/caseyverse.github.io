# Introduction

What started out as a simple means to keep track of everything, the Caseyverse (or Casey Universe) is a [public domain](legal/license.md) science-fiction [collaborative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_fiction) universe named after [Zack Casey](./characters/zackc.md).

This book is optimized for AI-based text adventures, such as [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/home) or [KoboldAI](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client), and so may have some have redundancies in the text.
