# Introduction

Named after [Zack Casey](./characters/zackc.md), the Caseyverse (or Casey Universe) is a [collaborative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_fiction) science-fiction universe based on Tony Bark's characters and world that's in the [public domain](legal/license.md).

This book is optimized for AI-based text adventures, such as [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/home) or [KoboldAI](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client), and so has a lot of redundancies in the text.
