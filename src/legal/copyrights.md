## Winnie the Pooh

As of January 1st, 2022, the character rights and locations from A. A. Milne's original Winnie-the-Pooh book have been moved into the public domain. However, Walt Disney's [1966 adoption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie_the_Pooh_(Disney_character)) and Tigger, who debuted in later books, remains under copyright but can treated as a derivative work going forward. The Hundred Arce Woods and Winnie the Pooh, as Edward Bear, have been integrated into the Caseyverse.

I'm not a fan of the current copyright laws. [Life of the author **plus an additional 70 years**](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-duration.html)? Haha! No. I'm lucky to be alive at a time where Winnie the Pooh is finally out of copyright. For that reason, I hereby waive all content, characters, setting, appearances related to the Caseyverse in the [public domain](./license.md).
