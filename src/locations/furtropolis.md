# Furtropolis

Furtropolis is a massive neon-lit city. The city is divided into various districts, from urban to residential areas. It's the kind of place where you can get lost in the crowd and never be found. Where you can lose yourself in a sea of strangers, or find yourself in an ocean of technology.
