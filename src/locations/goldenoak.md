### Phages

Phages are a hybrid between a living microbe and virus. They infect and replicate within a specific pathogenic bacteria. There are many phages for many different kinds of bacteria.

They are harmless not only to the host organism but also to other beneficial bacteria. Phages carry a slew of bacterial proteins of their own that provide benefits to the immune system.
