# Maple Valley Acres

Located off the northern outskirts of Furtropolis, Maple Valley Acres is a farm owned by [Nate Holland](./../characters/nate.md). It has fields stretching to the horizons, divided by picket fences, and rows of bushes. All around you sheep and goats frolicked and loitered in the radiant pastures, and right in the center of the fields ran an old cobblestone road that made its way to a classic farmhouse with a modest courtyard. The farmhouse was looking as splendid as the fields around it.
