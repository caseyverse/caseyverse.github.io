# Metro

The Furtropolis Metro is a large, complex and sturdy subway system that also serves several jurisdictions outside of the city. The system is rather unique in that allows for regional trains to share the same track in order to stop or pass through on the way to their next destination. While system is not centered on any single station, certain stations do serve as an intersection between other lines, such as [Central Station](ctower.md).
