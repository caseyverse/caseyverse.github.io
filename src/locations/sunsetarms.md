# Sunset Arms

Home of [Kit Welsh](../characters/kit.md) and [Zach Casey](../characters/zackc.md), Sunset Arms is intimate and cozy home on the western corner of the corner of the city, near the [park](park.md). It has been built with brown bricks and has burgundy brick decorations. Small, rounded windows add to the overall style of the house and have been added to the house in a fairly asymmetrical pattern. The house is equipped with a small kitchen and three modern bathrooms, it also has a snug living room, five bedrooms, a grand dining room, a library and a cozy storage room.
