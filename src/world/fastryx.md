# Fastryx

Fastryx is a semiconductor and insulator material with high thermal conductivity that has no loss at higher temperatures compared to conventional superconductors do. It contains a type of quantum matter that has high mobility to electrons. Fastryx has started to replace the ubiquitous silicon in modern technology but it hasnâ€™t been without hiccups.
